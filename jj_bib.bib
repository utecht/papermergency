abstract = {The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) is an ontology that provides terms with precisely defined meanings to describe all aspects of how investigations in the biological and medical domains are conducted. OBI re-uses ontologies that provide a representation of biomedical knowledge from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) project and adds the ability to describe how this knowledge was derived. We here describe the state of OBI and several applications that are using it, such as adding semantic expressivity to existing databases, building data entry forms, and enabling interoperability between knowledge resources. OBI covers all phases of the investigation process, such as planning, execution and reporting. It represents information and material entities that participate in these processes, as well as roles and functions. Prior to OBI, it was not possible to use a single internally consistent resource that could be applied to multiple types of experiments for these applications. OBI has made this possible by creating terms for entities involved in biological and medical investigations and by importing parts of other biomedical ontologies such as GO, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) and Phenotype Attribute and Trait Ontology (PATO) without altering their meaning. OBI is being used in a wide range of projects covering genomics, multi-omics, immunology, and catalogs of services. OBI has also spawned other ontologies (Information Artifact Ontology) and methods for importing parts of ontologies (Minimum information to reference an external ontology term (MIREOT)). The OBI project is an open cross-disciplinary collaborative effort, encompassing multiple research communities from around the globe. To date, OBI has created 2368 classes and 40 relations along with textual and formal definitions. The OBI Consortium maintains a web resource (http://obi-ontology.org) providing details on the people, policies, and issues being addressed in association with OBI. The current release of OBI is available at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl.},

abstract = {The exponential growth in the volume of accessible biological information has generated a confusion of voices surrounding the annotation of molecular information about genes and their products. The Gene Ontology (GO) project seeks to provide a set of structured vocabularies for specific biological domains that can be used to describe gene products in any organism. This work includes building three extensive ontologies to describe molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, and providing a community database resource that supports the use of these ontologies. The GO Consortium was initiated by scientists associated with three model organism databases: SGD, the Saccharomyces Genome database; FlyBase, the Drosophila genome database; and MGD/GXD, the Mouse Genome Informatics databases. Additional model organism database groups are joining the project. Each of these model organism information systems is annotating genes and gene products using GO vocabulary terms and incorporating these annotations into their respective model organism databases. Each database contributes its annotation files to a shared GO data resource accessible to the public at http://www.geneontology.org/. The GO site can be used by the community both to recover the GO vocabularies and to access the annotated gene product data sets from the model organism databases. The GO Consortium supports the development of the GO database resource and provides tools enabling curators and researchers to query and manipulate the vocabularies. We believe that the shared development of this molecular annotation resource will contribute to the unification of biological information.},

abstract = {The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a commonly used standard for creating ontology artifacts. However, its capabilities for reusing existing OWL artifacts in the creation of new artifacts is limited to the import of whole ontologies, even when only a small handful of classes, object properties, and so on (which we refer to generically as OWL components) are relevant. This situation can result in extremely large and unwieldy, or even broken, ontologies. To address this problem while still promoting ontology reuse, the OBI Consortium has elucidated the Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term (MIREOT). We provide a suite of plugins to the Protege editor that greatly simplifies the use of MIREOT principles during ontology creation and editing.},

@article{Schober2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A wide variety of ontologies relevant to the biological and medical domains are available through the OBO Foundry portal, and their number is growing rapidly. Integration of these ontologies, while requiring considerable effort, is extremely desirable. However, heterogeneities in format and style pose serious obstacles to such integration. In particular, inconsistencies in naming conventions can impair the readability and navigability of ontology class hierarchies, and hinder their alignment and integration. While other sources of diversity are tremendously complex and challenging, agreeing a set of common naming conventions is an achievable goal, particularly if those conventions are based on lessons drawn from pooled practical experience and surveys of community opinion. RESULTS: We summarize a review of existing naming conventions and highlight certain disadvantages with respect to general applicability in the biological domain. We also present the results of a survey carried out to establish which naming conventions are currently employed by OBO Foundry ontologies and to determine what their special requirements regarding the naming of entities might be. Lastly, we propose an initial set of typographic, syntactic and semantic conventions for labelling classes in OBO Foundry ontologies. CONCLUSION: Adherence to common naming conventions is more than just a matter of aesthetics. Such conventions provide guidance to ontology creators, help developers avoid flaws and inaccuracies when editing, and especially when interlinking, ontologies. Common naming conventions will also assist consumers of ontologies to more readily understand what meanings were intended by the authors of ontologies used in annotating bodies of data.},

In the CAF{\'{E}} project we aim to provide a web-service enabling ontol-ogy-driven comparison of the organizational characteristics of trauma centers and trauma systems. Trauma remains one of the biggest challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Research has demonstrated that coordinated efforts like trauma systems and trauma centers are key components of addressing this chal-lenge. Evaluation and comparison of these organizations is es-sential. However, this research challenge is frequently com-pounded by the lack of a shared terminology and the lack of ef-fective information technology solutions for assessing and com-paring these organizations. In this paper we present the Ontol-ogy of Organizational Structures of Trauma systems and Trauma centers (OOSTT) that provides the ontological founda-tion to CAF{\'{E}}'s web-based questionnaire infrastructure.

	abstract = {Omeprazole (OP) is a potent antiulcer drug that is metabolized by liver cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. However, the identities of the P450 isoforms responsible for its metabolism have been controversial. 5-Hydroxyomeprazole (5OH-OP) formation cosegregates with the polymorphism of (S)-mephenytoin 4{\textquoteright}-hydroxylation in humans, which is now known to be mediated by CYP2C19. Previous in vitro studies have indicated that liver microsomal 50H-OP formation correlates with both (S)-mephenytoin 4{\textquoteright}-hydroxylase and CYP3A content. Inhibitor and CYP2C antibody studies also suggested that both enzymes may be involved in the 5-hydroxylation of OP, whereas CYP3A appears to be the predominant enzyme involved in OP sulfone (OP-S) formation. The present studies assessed the contribution of various CYP2C and CYP3A4 enzymes to OP metabolism by using recombinant human enzymes. CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C18, and CYP2C9 formed a single metabolite with an HPLC retention time identical to that of 5OH-OP. The turnover number for CYP2C19 was 13.4 +/- 1.4 nmol/min/nmol of P450, whereas those for CYP2C8, CYP2C18, and CYP2C9 were 2.2 +/- 0.1, 1.5 +/- 0.1, and approximately equal to 0.5 nmol/min/nmol of P450, respectively. Recombinant human CYP3A4 formed 5OH-OP and OP-S with turnover numbers of 5.7 +/- 1.1 and 7.4 +/- 0.9 nmol/min/nmol of P450, respectively, and formed a minor unidentified metabolite. CYP2C19 had a substantially lower KM for 5OH-OP formation than did CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or CYP2C18. Antibody to CYP2C proteins inhibited approximately equal to 70\% of OP 5-hydroxylation at low substrate concentrations, comparable to those that may be encountered at therapeutically relevant doses, whereas antibody to CYP3A4 inhibited approximately equal to 30\% of the activity. At high substrate concentrations, the contributions of the two enzymes to OP hydroxylation were roughly comparable (40-50\%). In contrast, OP-S formation was completely inhibited by antibody to CYP3A4 proteins. The present study provides the first direct confirmation, using human recombinant P450 enzymes and selective antibody inhibition, that CYP2C19 is a major high affinity OP 5-hydroxylase and CYP3A4 is a low affinity OP-hydroxylating enzyme. The current work also shows, for the first time, that other CYP2C enzymes (CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C18) may contribute to OP hydroxylation at high substrate concentrations. In contrast, OP-S was formed principally by CYP3A4.},
